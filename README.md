This project assumes you have installed and configured [mise].  If you have, it should automatically warn you if you do not have the
required versions of [node], [pnpm], [just], and other build tools the project depends on.  Any exceptions will be noted here.

Assuming that you *do* have mise, and it has *not* complained, you can simply run

```
mise install
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

[mise]: https://mise.jdx.dev/
[node]: https://nodejs.org/
[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/
